# National Sales Operations & Logistic optimization (2021-2026).
## 📌 Project Overview
Designed an end-to-end Sales & Operations pipeline for a national automotive retailer. The model analyzes the complexity of a Lagos-centralized distribution system delivering high-value assets to individual customers across 16 Nigerian states. The project evaluates how transit distance impacts customer delivery timelines and regional revenue growth.

# Expanded State List (The 16 States)
- South-West: Lagos, Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ondo, Ekiti
- South-South: Rivers, Bayelsa, Edo
- South-East: Enugu, Imo, Anambra
- North/Central: FCT (Abuja), Kano, Katsina, Benue

## 🔄Refined ETL Steps
- Data Synchronization: Used Python to map Car Models to correct Parent Brands, ensuring 100% categorical accuracy.
- Logistics Simulation: Developed a distance-based engine to calculate realistic delivery lead times from the Lagos hub to 16 states.
- Financial Normalization: Optimized discount variables (capping at 12%) and recalculated total revenue to reflect realistic market margins.

## 📈 Business-Focused Insights
- Logistics Bottlenecks: While Lagos remains the revenue powerhouse, individual deliveries to Katsina and Kano face an average 60+ hour lead time. This identifies a critical need for regional 'Transit Points' to improve the customer experience in the North.  
- Market Penetration: High individual demand in Anambra and Edo suggests strong emerging markets outside of the traditional Lagos/PH/Abuja hubs.
- Operational Risk: The centralized 'Lagos Warehouse' model is efficient for the South-West but creates a 'Delivery Delay' risk for 25% of the national customer base.
