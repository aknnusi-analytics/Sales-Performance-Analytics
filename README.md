# National Sales Operations & Logistic optimization (2021-2026).
## 📌 Project Overview
Developed a data pipeline to analyze 8,000+ transactions for a centralized automotive distributor. The project focuses on the logistics efficiency of shipping from a Lagos-based warehouse to 16 states, identifying regional bottlenecks and optimizing discount strategies to protect profit margins.

## 🔄Refined ETL Steps
- Data Synchronization: Used Python to map Car Models to correct Parent Brands, ensuring 100% categorical accuracy.
- Logistics Simulation: Developed a distance-based engine to calculate realistic delivery lead times from the Lagos hub to 16 states.
- Financial Normalization: Optimized discount variables (capping at 12%) and recalculated total revenue to reflect realistic market margins.

## 📈 Business-Focused Insights
- Regional Efficiency: Identified a 40% delivery delay risk in the Northern region (Kano/Katsina), providing a data-backed argument for a secondary regional hub.  
- Pricing Strategy: Foreign-used units (Lexus/Benz) show a 15% higher profit margin than economy brands, suggesting a shift in inventory focus for 2026.  
- Revenue Sustainability: By normalizing discount rates to 4.5%, the model demonstrates a path to increased net profit without decreasing sales volume.  
- Month-on-month revenue trends identified for decision-making
